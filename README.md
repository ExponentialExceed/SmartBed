# SmartBed
my second project and The last project in eXceed

### Introduction
In the future people will work hard all time and everybody are ignored about sleeping, So this project will help people who get not enough sleep to have enough sleep.
### Information
As we sleep you go through different phases, ranging for deep sleep to light sleep.
Step of sleep phases is
- first stage
  - Eyes is closed but easy to wake up, this phase may last for 1-10 minutes.
  - if you irregular sleeping habits tend to have these more often
- second stage
  - Light sleep: heart rate will slow down and temperature drops, this phase may last for 20 minutes.
  - And the most night is in this stage (around 45% of the total duration).
- last stage
  - Deep sleep: it's harder to rouse you during this stage. this stage will starts 35-45 minutes after asleep

So in this information is more deep sleep is more healthy

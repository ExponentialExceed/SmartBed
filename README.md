## Introduction

In the future people will work hard all time and everybody are ignored about sleeping, So this project will help people who get not enough sleep to have enough sleep.

## Sleep Information

As we sleep you go through different phases, ranging for deep sleep to light sleep. There are a few step of sleeping phases.

### First stage

This phase may last for 1 to 10 minutes. The eyes is closed but easy to wake up. if you irregular sleeping habits tend to have these more often

### Second stage

We also called **Light sleep** which heart rate will slow down and temperature drops, this phase may last for 20 minutes. And the most of a night will be on this stage (around 45% of the total duration).

### Last stage

We can called **Deep sleep** it's harder to rouse you during this stage. 
this stage will starts 35-45 minutes after asleep

So with this information, more deep sleep is more healthy.

## Project detail

In this project have 2 main parts, software and hardware.

### Software

Basically, the software split to 2 parts, `analysic` and `frondend UI`. In the frontend that yo can see the information in form of chart and table and also the message for the sleeping time and date.

#### Development

To run the website locally, you have to run on the terminal/cmd by using this command `node server.js` in [software](software) folder. This require at least node 7^ and browser.

### Hardware

Basically, This is a bed which contain alarm clock and a lot of sensor to detech data and send to software to analize them and show on the website.

The sensor that we use. 
- temp sensor
- motion sensor
- sound sensor
- light sensor
